Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

Project Workflow
1. Loaded and cleaned loan application data
2. Encoded categorical features
3. Trained a Random Forest classifier
4. Evaluated the model using accuracy score (~98%)

Result
The model achieved high accuracy in predicting loan approval decisions.

How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells from top to bottom
3. View accuracy and sample loan prediction output
